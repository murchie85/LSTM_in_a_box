hahaha that's hilarious
hey guys it's ray william johnson here
with another cringe of the week there's
certain things that you read online that
you would never hope to hear in real
life and you know i know a lot of you've
seen this video but i kind of want to go
over it because it makes me cringe so
today's video is that we got some folks
here in front of an abortion clinic i'm
guessing so you got some pro lifers here
doing their thing suddenly out of
nowhere a nice young lady comes and
decides to give him some trouble simple
quandary you know a little bit of banter
a little bit of banter and then the
crackit is released
dipshit I get that camera out of my face
see wait I won't call the police
yo we got Bruce Lee over here only a
fucking Robocop over here looks like a
million cameras on him and she makes the
pitiful attempt at making a run for it
you're going pretty fast there episode
the guy finally catches up to her and
she gets all up in his face
fucking sexist misogynistic
motherfuckers
I thought you are but this is the best
part you zoom in and she's one Burger
King shit she works the Burger King that
is poetic if she want a Burger King
employee guess what her major was in
college yeah Gender Studies
now that's edgy as fuck she probably
spits in every man's burger how dare you
tell me to make burgers for you you sis
white male even though it is my job now
that's edgy as fuck anything this video
could show us that abortion is wrong
because what a great time it is to be
alive why would you want to miss
something like this huh
now that's cringe wait wait it's the
cringe train taking old passengers
ready to take you to cringe central
board oh now that's edgy as fuck and
she's all up in his face screaming and
the guys just like understand me
motherfucker I'm listening to you this
dude it's like okay great and then she
goes in - a fucking bus for some reason
she was probably looking for Thought
Catalog and then two cops come on like
bicycles like that's gonna do anything
you're gonna need like six horse
tranquilizers now anyways I know a lot
of you have seen this video but I just
wanted to share it again because it's
fucking gold and keep in mind I'm not
ragging on feminists or pro-lifers or
pro-choicers whatever if you can be
whatever the fuck you want I'm just
riding on this chick for being a total
dipshit you know it's good that you're
standing up for your rights but just
don't be a dipshit I'll see y'all
bitches later I love you
now that's edgy as fuck

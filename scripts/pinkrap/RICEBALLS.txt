Let's all go to the lobby
Let's all go to the lobby
Let's all go to the lobby
To get ourselves a---
Welcome to the terror dome; the upper echelon
Investing on these large balls
I got these pussy bitches wailing like the Japanese
Killer whales, humpbacks, and these narwhals;
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these fuckers
I'm just trying to strangle these
This the beep blop, you make the beat flop
Breathing more cushion than the seat got, so we got
The beat dropping harder than your son's balls at twelve, not
To mention that we harder than Viagra with a big cock
I'll fuck you in the mouth again
I'll let you know that I'm a schizo; I be hearing shit
So don't be fucking me, cause bet your ass I'm hearing it
When I get done with you I make sure that you're celibate
(Ewwwwwwwww)
Fuck you dog, I can smack out your teeth
And I'll fuck you with a radiator pipe
(What, is that too rude?)
I'm a fucking nuisance
With different types of abuses
I'm running up in the premises
Helping you tie your nooses
Cause all of you fucks are clueless
And do not know how to do this
I act retarded on stage and then put my fingers in pusses
Like oh
Like oh
Oh
Oh
I fuck around for money like a cam whore
Jerk it to my titties, pop it off on some gay shit
I fight your dad in the parking lots and/or
Beat their fucking teeth in cause they raised shit
You sound like "I never spanked my kids and I raised a piece of shit and I drop my kids off at soccer practice every Tuesday" This one's for the folks that be dead inside
Mini-golf champion; you got no drive, player
Fuckboys treat my dick like a trampoline
I only work with paper like a fax machine
I'm on the car's hood screaming like a mammal
Ripping through the flannel burning ass on my chest with the camels
I'm here to be an act not a role model
Don't be fucking crying when I'm smashing your kid with a bottle
I'm just chilling making rice balls everyday
I'm a simple man, I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
I don't need a microwave
Cause I'm already heated (That's not funny)
(Uh, we want real music)
(We want real music, we want Joji music)
(Huh, huh, huh)
Bro, I didn't even know real and fake music existed
I mean, I think it's like your fault for putting that shit into categories
Like, music is music; if you don't think this is real music that's your fucking problem
Like, who says I can't drop shit while making a culinary funny video at the same time, you know?
Whatever man, it's your boy Pink Guy, Pink Omega; whatever the fuck you wanna call me, I don't give a fuck
Coming at you again, still doing that wacky crazy shit bro, ain't nothing changed, so see you next time

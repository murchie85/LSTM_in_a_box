Yeah, PinkOmega
Yeah, PinkOmega
One bad chef in a kitchen full of dough
Three bad bitches with their hands on the stove
Making home movies with a handful of stoges
I'm cooking all the dumplings
I'm cooking all the dumplings
Motherfuckers want to act funny
Tryna be a man when your nose all runny
Go to pre-K, put your bag in your cubby
Motherfucking gimmick, like your man Jeff Dunnie
But who am I to talk? Making preteens laugh for the money
Act dumb, slicker than honey, whoops
Rapping in the kitchen but got no silver spoon
But I feed on the bitches, bitches
Bad to the bone, prone to the homegrown
Girls moan when I come home, dick like an ozone
Wanna step in the ring?
Just skin and a sack of shitty meat like dumplings
Boy, I don't wear Gucci
Still classy, but rotten like blue cheese
We're about to make a movie
With a handheld Sony, puffing on a loosie
"Cooking the dumplings all day"
Is the only thing I say when I mind my business
Get the fuck out of my kitchen
I'm cooking up a storm, boy, none of that beef shit
They say I'm the man in your nightmares
Your girl in the bed screaming "right there"
I'm high on the weed and the xanny
I find it uncanny there's so much poonani
They found me in the lab doing stem cell research
I was trying to grow you some balls
The police came, but I explained about your bitching
Now they want to pitch in and support the cause
Hate my ways? That's a personal issue
Because you're thinking about me, put down the tissues (ew)
Why you still yapping to me?
Didn't Mommy tell you not to converse with a stranger?
Are you crying in the stall with a belt and a razor?
Are you really that mad or just a bad imitator?
Oh, because I never heard of your dumb ass (nope)
Go fuck yourself in the mouth with a taser. (whoop)
'Cause I'm cooking all the dumplings
'Cause I'm cooking all the dumplings
'Cause I'm cooking all the dumplings
'Cause I'm cooking all the dumplings
One bad chef in a kitchen full of dough
Three bad bitches with their hands on the stove
Making home movies with a handful of stoges
I'm cooking all the dumplings
I'm cooking all the dumplings

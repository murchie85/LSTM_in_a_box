I wake up in the mornings
Sinking halfway to the bottom
There's a loud distorted screaming in my soul
Everything is dark and empty
And I don't know how to fix it
So I curl up in a ball
And cry in the comfort of my home
I don't know why
I feel like shit
I say I'm fine but I'm not fine
I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide
All my deepest feelings
I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide
All my deepest feelings
I think there's something wrong with me
'Cause all I see is death
Every time I go outside
I look like I've been doing meth
And I sleep for nineteen hours
On a Thursday afternoon
Every now and then I cough up blood
And I don't know what to do
I don't know why
I feel like shit
I will not see a therapist
Ladies and gentlemen, if you wanna fucking kill yourself put your fucking hands up (yeah!)
Raise your blades in the air everybody (yeah!)
*coughing*
Ay, oh, ay, oh, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, help, help, help, help, help, help, HELP!
I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide
All my deepest feelings
I'm dying inside
And all I see are demons
I try to hide
All my deepest feelings
